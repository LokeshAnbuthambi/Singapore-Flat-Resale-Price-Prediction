# Singapore-Flat-Resale-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a python code to preprocess the singapore flat data to train ML which can be used to develop a streamlit user friendly application for predicting the reselling price using the ML

# Data Cleaning / Preprocessing
The given data has been thoroughly checked and took a cleaning process and preprocessed the data to avail it for ML training

# Machine learning
The data has been splitted and trained and used the various regression model to predict the results with high accuracy rate.
With the high accuracy, the model should be pickled to use it to develop the streamlit application

# Streamlit
Developed a streamlit application to use it as user friendly flat reselling price prediction model.
